# Elasticsearch introduction.

Elasticsearch is a distributed document store. 
Instead of storing information as rows of columnar data, Elasticsearch stores complex data structures that have been serialized as JSON documents.

Documents are indexed and fully searchable in near real-time-- within 1 second. Elastic search uses data structure called inverted index that supports very fast full text search.

Elasticsearch indexes all data in every field and each indexed field has a dedicated, optimized data structure. For example, text fields are stored in inverted indices, and numeric and geo fields are stored in BKD trees.
